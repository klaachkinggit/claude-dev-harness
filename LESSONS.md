Append-only log of heuristics learned. Read at session start alongside `MEMORY.md`. See `prompts/learn.md` for what goes in.

## YYYY-MM-DD — short title  [workflow|debug|test|arch|tools|prompt|cost]
- **Saw:** what happened (one line).
- **Why:** the underlying reason it worked / failed.
- **Next time:** the heuristic future-you will actually re-read.

## 2026-06-16 — idempotent generated config  [tools]
- **Saw:** Codex MCP config kept an obsolete generated `git` server because `tools/gen-mcp.py` refused to update existing `mcp_servers`.
- **Why:** Manual-merge output is not a real harness fix; applied projects keep stale generated sections.
- **Next time:** Generators should replace their managed sections and preserve custom sections, not print blocks for humans to merge.

## 2026-06-16 — mirror behavior, not byte-for-byte files  [tools]
- **Saw:** Claude and Codex hook mirrors failed a strict diff even though provider-local paths legitimately differ.
- **Why:** Mirror parity means equivalent capability surfaces, not identical implementation text when providers need different wiring.
- **Next time:** Audits should compare shared names/contracts and then validate provider-specific config separately.

## 2026-06-17 — test applied projects, not only the harness repo  [test]
- **Saw:** The temp-project integration test caught that `audit-capabilities.sh` required `apply.sh`, which applied projects do not contain.
- **Why:** A harness repo can have maintenance files that target projects should not carry.
- **Next time:** Integration tests for harness tooling should run from a fresh applied project and distinguish maintenance-only files from installed files.

## 2026-06-17 — preserve existing MCP config on adoption  [tools]
- **Saw:** Codex MCP generation preserved custom servers, but Claude `.mcp.json` generation overwrote them.
- **Why:** Applying a harness mid-project is an adoption path, not a greenfield-only installer.
- **Next time:** Generated provider config should replace only harness-managed entries and preserve project-owned entries.

## 2026-06-18 — test the installed harness, not just the source repo  [test]
- **Saw:** Installed CI referenced a harness-only integration script, and shell hook tests missed escaped JSON cases.
- **Why:** Source-repo checks can pass while applied projects lack the files or payload shape that agents actually use.
- **Next time:** Every harness feature needs a temp-project assertion using the installed files and valid provider-like JSON payloads.

## 2026-06-18 — source checks stay source-local  [test]
- **Saw:** Provider rule drift is a source-harness invariant, but applied projects intentionally own their project-specific rule tails.
- **Why:** Installed-project audits should validate applied behavior; generator parity should be checked before shipping the harness source.
- **Next time:** Put generation drift checks in source preflight with a check-only mode, not in target-project audits that lack the generator context.

## 2026-06-20 — package-only profiles  [tools]
- **Saw:** `ponytail` exists as an npm package with no CLI, MCP server, or README.
- **Why:** Treating every named capability as a runtime/tool integration would create fake provider wiring.
- **Next time:** If a capability is package-only, model it as a provider-neutral package profile and document that it updates project files rather than agent runtime config.
